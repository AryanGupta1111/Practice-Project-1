### ✅ **🔥 Roadmap for Building Your Daily Activity Tracker Project (HTML, CSS, JS)**

---

### 🎯 **1️⃣ 💡 Basic Topics to Learn First**

To build this project, you need to understand the following **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** concepts:

---

### 🚀 **🔹 HTML (Structure)**  
1. **Input Elements:**  
   - `<input type="button">`, `<input type="text">`, `<input type="date">`  
   - Learn how to create forms and buttons.  

2. **Form Elements:**  
   - `<form>` for collecting and submitting responses.  
   - `<label>` for naming the activities properly.  
   - `<div>` or `<ul>` to display the stored responses.  

3. **Table or List:**  
   - To display the activity name and responses over time.  

✅ **HTML Topics to Learn:**
- `<input>` types (text, button, date).  
- `<form>` and `<label>`.  
- `<div>` and `<table>` for structuring.  

---

### 🚀 **🔹 CSS (Styling)**  
1. **Basic Styling:**  
   - Use **flexbox** or **grid** to align buttons and input fields.  
   - Apply margins, padding, and borders.  
   - Use **box-shadow** and `hover` effects to make the UI look better.  

2. **Responsive Design:**  
   - Use **media queries** for mobile and desktop views.  

✅ **CSS Topics to Learn:**  
- `display: flex;` and `grid`.  
- `padding`, `margin`, `border`, and `box-shadow`.  
- `hover` effects.  
- Media queries.  

---

### 🚀 **🔹 JavaScript (Functionality)**  
You will handle the logic with JavaScript, so you need to learn the following:

---

### **✅ a) Basics**
- `let`, `const`, and `var` for declaring variables.  
- `document.querySelector()` and `document.getElementById()` for selecting HTML elements.  
- `addEventListener()` to trigger events like button clicks.  
- **Date and Time Handling:**  
   - `new Date()` → to get the current date.  
   - `.toISOString()` or `.toLocaleDateString()` → to format the date.  
- **Local Storage:**  
   - Learn how to store and retrieve data using `localStorage` to save the activity responses.  

---

### **✅ b) Core Logic**
1. **Get the current date automatically**  
   - Use `new Date()` to automatically get today’s date.  
   - Format the date as `YYYY-MM-DD`.  

2. **Check if the current day already has a response**  
   - Store responses in `localStorage`.  
   - Compare the current date with stored dates.  
   - If a response for today exists, show a message:  
   `Response already recorded for today.`  

3. **Modify the response**  
   - Allow modifying the current day’s response.  

4. **Calculate missed responses**  
   - Find the difference between the **project start date** and the **current date**.  
   - Calculate the difference in days.  
   - Compare it with the total responses stored.  
   - If they don’t match, display:  
   `You have missed X responses.`  

---

### 🚀 **🔹 LocalStorage (Storing Responses)**  
1. **Learn how to:**  
   - Store responses using `localStorage.setItem()`.  
   - Retrieve responses using `localStorage.getItem()`.  
   - Store them as objects with `JSON.stringify()` and retrieve using `JSON.parse()`.  

---

### 🎯 **2️⃣ 🔥 Project Structure**
Here’s how you should structure your project:  

✅ **📁 Folder Structure:**
```
/activity-tracker
 ├── index.html      → HTML file (structure)
 ├── style.css       → CSS file (styling)
 ├── script.js       → JavaScript file (functionality)
```

---

### 🎯 **3️⃣ 🔥 Features You Will Implement**
✅ **HTML Structure:**  
- 5 activities (each with 2 buttons: Yes and No).  
- Display area for responses.  
- Button for modifying responses.  

✅ **CSS Styling:**  
- Stylish layout with flexbox or grid.  
- Hover effects for buttons.  
- Responsive design for smaller screens.  

✅ **JavaScript Functionality:**  
- Automatically fetch the current date.  
- Allow one response per day.  
- Show message if response already exists.  
- Store responses using `localStorage`.  
- Modify the current day’s response.  
- Calculate and display missed responses.  

---

### 🎯 **🔥 Step-by-Step Plan to Build the Project**

---

### ✅ **Step 1: HTML - Create the Layout**
- Create input fields, buttons, and display area.  
- Use **divs or tables** to show stored responses.  

---

### ✅ **Step 2: CSS - Add Styling**
- Use flexbox/grid for alignment.  
- Style buttons and input fields.  
- Add hover effects.  
- Ensure it looks clean and readable.  

---

### ✅ **Step 3: JavaScript - Add Functionality**
1. **Get Current Date:**  
   - Use `new Date()` and format it as `YYYY-MM-DD`.  

2. **Store Responses:**  
   - Store the response (`Yes`, `No`, or `Missed`) with the date in `localStorage`.  

3. **Check for Duplicate Responses:**  
   - Check if a response exists for today’s date.  
   - If yes → show `Response already recorded`.  
   - If no → store the new response.  

4. **Modify Response:**  
   - Add a button to **modify the current day’s response**.  
   - Update the value in `localStorage`.  

5. **Calculate Missed Responses:**  
   - Use the **project start date** and **current date**.  
   - Find the difference in days.  
   - Compare the difference with the total responses stored.  
   - If they don’t match, display:  
   `You have missed X responses.`  

---

### 🎯 **4️⃣ 🔥 Tools and Resources**
✅ **Editor:**  
- VS Code or any code editor.  

✅ **Browser:**  
- Test in Chrome or Firefox.  

✅ **Local Server:**  
- Use **Live Server** extension for real-time preview.  

✅ **Storage:**  
- Use **LocalStorage** to store responses.
